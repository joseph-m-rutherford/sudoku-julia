Solving Sudoku puzzles the fun way -- with programming!

Copyright 2021 Joseph M. Rutherford

This project is what happened when I solved a Sudoku puzzle, and took note of
the process my brain followed to compose a solution.  Once I could see an
algorithm, I was hooked and knew I needed to code it up.  Then I consulted with
a family-member on how she solved the puzzles, and I saw that there really was
a lot of fun to be had in the process of the solution.

If I wanted to solve puzzles, of course I could just go find any of a number of
solutions already available, which isn't any fun. I've been looking for an
excuse to learn Julia, so this project really is about me learning to solve an
interesting problem in a new language. It just so happens that one needs a goal
in order to progress, so solving Sudokus is a means to the end of learning.

This project was ironed out in some spare time between Thanksgiving 2021 and
the initialization of the repository on December 17, 2021.
