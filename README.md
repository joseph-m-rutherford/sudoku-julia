Solving Sudoku puzzles the fun way -- with programming!

This project is about me learning to solve an interesting problem
(Sudoku puzzles) in a new programming language. The primary goal is for
me to learn Julia, and learning about a popular puzzle is secondary.  The
concrete goal of solving the puzzles is but a means to the end of learning.
If this helps anyone else learn, too, then all the better!

The initial form of this project was ironed out in some spare time between
Thanksgiving 2021 and the initialization of the repository on December 17, 2021.
